How to hash a number and find the number from the same hash
How to hash a number and find the number from the same hash In the console, an application written with Java in the file PasswordGenerator takes 
a minimum and a maximum to generate a password for you. Then you give this created password after running the file IntHasher password and get
the 256 SHA hash. In the next step, the database we created and hashed from 1 to 500,000 or more and stored in the database. And we give the hash 
of our password that we have to the program and compares it with the hashes in the database. 
If it is in the database, it will return the existing number to us. If not, it will find it for us using a loop.
